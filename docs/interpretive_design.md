# Interpretive Design

EchoTrace – Whispering Objects is designed around the idea that collections invite meaning-making when visitors can assemble, test, and share interpretations together. The installation draws from several learning frameworks:

- **Constructivism** – Visitors build knowledge by connecting familiar sensory cues (sound, vibration, light) with fragmentary narratives. Each whisper contributes partial context, encouraging visitors to actively assemble meaning rather than passively consuming a finished story.
- **Falk & Dierking’s Contextual Model** – Personal context is honoured through multilingual fragments and adjustable accessibility presets. Sociocultural context is foregrounded when visitors compare what they heard and co-create the finale. Physical context matters: proximity sensing and haptic prompts reward embodied exploration of the gallery space.
- **Embodied Cognition** – Knowledge emerges through action. Leaning close to an object, feeling a pulse, or sensing a glow links the body to the story, sustaining attention and memory.
- **Inquiry & Narrative Reconstruction** – Whisper nodes seed “clues” that spark prediction (“What connects these objects?”). Unlocking the mystery object confirms or complicates hypotheses, inviting visitors to revisit fragments and renegotiate meaning.
- **Distributed Learning** – No single node contains the entire story. Groups must circulate, share findings, and collaborate to reach the finale. Accessibility presets ensure all participants can contribute—captions, sensory-friendly pacing, and mobility buffers lower barriers.

## Visitor Journey

1. **Approach & Discovery** – Ambient whispers lure visitors to lean closer. LEDs glow subtly when someone enters the proximity field.
2. **Embodied Engagement** – Crossing the story threshold triggers richer audio, LED pulses, and optional haptics. Visitors may note unique details or emotions.
3. **Collaborative Sense-Making** – Teams discuss what they heard, scan the QR transcripts for deeper context, and compare fragments across objects.
4. **Mystery Unlock** – After enough fragments, the mystery object activates, weaving contributions into a shared conclusion. This moment encourages reflection: “Which fragments mattered? What did we infer together?”
5. **Reflection & Re-entry** – Visitors can revisit nodes, adjust accessibility modes (e.g., sensory-friendly), or revisit transcripts for extended interpretation.

## Learning Goals

- Promote curiosity-driven exploration of collections.
- Support collaborative storytelling where multiple perspectives are valid.
- Highlight the role of sensory evidence in constructing historical or cultural narratives.
- Encourage reflection on how access accommodations (captions, pacing, tactility) shift interpretive understanding.

By fusing embodied cues with cooperative inquiry, EchoTrace transforms object engagement into a participatory narrative exercise that complements informal learning in museums and memory institutions.
