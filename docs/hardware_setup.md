# Hardware Setup Guide

This guide outlines the components and wiring required to deploy EchoTrace in a gallery environment.

## Bill of Materials

**Hub (x1)**
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (4 GB RAM recommended)
- microSD card (32 GB+), Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- USB-C power supply
- Heatsink or case with ventilation
- Optional: UPS HAT for graceful shutdown

**Nodes (x4 whisper + x1 mystery)**
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W per node
- microSD card (16 GB+)
- VL53L1X time-of-flight sensor breakout (Adafruit or Pimoroni)
- Class-D audio amplifier (PAM8302 or similar) + small 4 Ω speaker
- GPIO-controllable LED with 220 Ω resistor (use PWM-capable pin such as GPIO18)
- Optional: coin vibration motor with NPN transistor + flyback diode for haptics
- 5 V 2 A power supply (USB-C or micro USB depending on model)
- 3D-printed mounts or laser-cut panels for sensor alignment

## Wiring Overview

- Connect VL53L1X via I2C: SDA → GPIO2, SCL → GPIO3, VIN → 3V3, GND → GND. Keep wires short and shielded where possible.
- LED: anode to GPIO18 through a 220 Ω resistor, cathode to GND.
- Audio amplifier: Feed from Pi headphone jack (or USB audio dongle), power from 5 V rail, speaker to amplifier output.
- Haptics (optional): GPIO23 → base of NPN transistor via 1 kΩ resistor, motor between 5 V and collector, emitter to GND, diode across motor.

Refer to `fabrication/wiring_fritzing.png` for a starter schematic. Adapt the layout to your mounts and enclosures.

## Physical Installation

1. Mount sensors at visitor chest height, angled downward (~10–15°) to avoid cross-talk between nodes.
2. Use the provided STL files to 3D print bezels and LED holders. Secure with museum-safe adhesives or mechanical fasteners.
3. Route speaker cables and USB power inside exhibit furniture; strain relief is essential for public galleries.
4. Label each node with its ID (object1–object4, mystery) to match the configuration files.

## Software Installation

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto each microSD card.
2. Enable SSH (`sudo raspi-config` → Interface Options → SSH) for remote updates.
3. On the hub, install Mosquitto (`sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients`).
4. Clone this repository into `/opt/echotrace` on the hub and `/opt/echotrace-node` on each node.
5. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies: `python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Review `hub/config.yaml` and each node’s `pi_nodes/node_config.yaml` to ensure broker hostnames, node IDs, and audio file paths are correct.

## Enabling Services

1. Copy `system/hub.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/echotrace-hub.service` on the hub and `system/node.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/echotrace-node.service` on nodes.
2. Optionally create `/etc/default/echotrace` or `/etc/default/echotrace-node` to override environment variables (e.g., `ECHOTRACE_ADMIN_USER`, `ECHOTRACE_DIR`).
3. Reload systemd: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
4. Enable services: `sudo systemctl enable --now echotrace-hub` (hub) and `sudo systemctl enable --now echotrace-node` (nodes).
5. Check status with `sudo systemctl status echotrace-hub` and inspect logs via `journalctl -u echotrace-hub -f` during initial runs.

## Calibration Tips

- Use the dashboard’s **Calibration** view to note baseline distances. Adjust `story_threshold_mm` or `hysteresis_mm` via overrides if nodes trigger prematurely.
- For reflective environments, add matte shrouds around the VL53 sensor to minimise stray IR reflections.
- Balance audio levels by monitoring crowd noise—set base volume to ~0.6 and rely on the safety limiter to prevent spikes.

## Maintenance

- Keep sensors dust-free; clean with a soft lint-free cloth.
- Inspect printed brackets and laser-cut panels for wear. Replace as needed; the STL/DXF files are in `fabrication/` for quick reprints.
- Back up the content pack directory before editing live files.

With reliable wiring, secure mounting, and the provided systemd services, EchoTrace nodes will boot directly into interactive mode, allowing staff to focus on facilitation instead of manual configuration.
